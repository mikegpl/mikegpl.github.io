If you need more end-to-end solution than [Introspector](/introspector/), e.g. you need to collect the questionnaire data, provide the feedback and
also export the collected data in a data-science-friendly way, `Faust` might be right choice. `Faust` is a cloud-hosted web application that enables:
- managing registration of participants to the experimental studies,
- creating multi-step surveys/questionnaires with the ability to serve both instant and delayed feedback to the participant,
- storing and managing the participants data in a secure, GDPR-compliant way,
- alerting the researchers about participants who are enrolled but haven't completed the questionnaires yet,
- verifying whether a participant's answers are reliable and not fraudulent.

`Faust` and its storage is hosted on our EU servers. Pay only for doing the science - pricing is based on number of participants and researchers. 

For example, a study consisting of 200 participants and 3 researchers that spans across 3 months would cost you:
`200 * 0.1$ + 3 * 10$ = 50$`. Save your researchers time and try out Faust for free - contact us via [contact form here](https://forms.gle/qsjpga2bFhXGd5Bk8)
