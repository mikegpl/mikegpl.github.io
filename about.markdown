Hornbeam is a result of collaboration between modern software engineering and empirical sciences. 

The idea behind Hornbeam is to apply commercially adopted solutions to the world of small and medium-scale research 
to empower the scientists to do the actual science more effortlessly. 

The projects we are currently working on:

- [Introspector](/introspector/) - tool for providing automated feedback for participants who fill out questionnnaires.
- [Faust](/faust/) - system for secure and fast management of data in managing research projects involving personal data.


Check out the list of scientific teams we recently cooperated with:

- [Erpinator Lab](https://www.facebook.com/ERPinatorLab) - neuroscience research group based in Krak√≥w, Poland. Used [Introspector](/introspector/) for providing
feedback to the participants.
